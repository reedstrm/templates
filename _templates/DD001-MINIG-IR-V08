To get this device into flashing mode you have to turn the power on and off 5 times, then the RGB strip begins to blink.

I was never able to use tuya-convert: started to setup with the native app, and it quit responding. Printed an adapter to hold
pogopins and flashed via tazmotizer. Added IR receiver config (it's a VS838 tied to serial Rx), tasmota receives NEC format keys
from the remote. You'll need to write your own rules to convert received data to changes in lights.
